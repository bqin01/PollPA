Hey there,

What’s your opinion on our parietal rules?

No, this isn’t just another survey from the administration. PollPA is an entirely student-run polling project that’s meant to be fun, anonymous, quick, and interesting.

This is the first poll. Welcome to the experiment.

Unlike other campus polls, there will never be more than five questions on a poll, and you’ll be able to see live results as soon as you submit your response &mdash; think Instagram polls, but better.

We hope you’ll join us. It won’t take more than thirty seconds.

(Sorry if you've already received this email. Due to a glitch on Monday, the school classified some of our emails as junk. We've fixed that.)

Best,
The PollPA Team

P.S.: The results are anonymous. Properly anonymous. You can read the code if you don’t believe us at <https://github.com/pollpa/PollPA>.
