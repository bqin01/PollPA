<hr>
<p><small>PollPA is a transparent and student-run campus polling platform. All votes are truly anonymous, and all aggregate results are made public. PollPA is not affiliated with Phillips Academy (so <i>you</i>, not administrators, get to decide what we ask). If you would like to not participate, you can update your <a href="https://pollpa.com{% url 'account' %}?token={{auth_token}}">account settings</a>. This email was sent to {{user.username}}.
