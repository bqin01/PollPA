<p>Hey there,</p>

<p>What’s your opinion on our parietal rules?</p>

<p>No, this isn’t just another survey from the administration. PollPA is an entirely student-run polling project that’s meant to be fun, anonymous, quick, and interesting.</p>

<p>This is the first poll. Welcome to the experiment.</p>

<p>Unlike other campus polls, there will never be more than five questions on a poll, and you’ll be able to see live results as soon as you submit your response &mdash; think Instagram polls, but better.</p>

<p>We hope you’ll join us. It won’t take more than thirty seconds.</p>

<p>(Sorry if you've already received this email. Due to a glitch on Monday, the school classified some of our emails as junk. We've fixed that.)</p>

<p>Best,<br>
The PollPA Team</p>

<p>P.S.: The results are anonymous. <i>Properly anonymous.</i> You can <a href="https://github.com/pollpa/PollPA">read the code</a> if you don’t believe us.</p>
